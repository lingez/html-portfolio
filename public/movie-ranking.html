<h1>The Best Movies According to Deadfool</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Joker</h3>

  One of my most favourite origin villain story. It's interesting to see how
  one's delusional thoughts<br />
  and being bullied drove a man to become who he is now known as the Joker. His
  ways may very well be <br />
  questionable but why he became what he became is perfectly reasonable but yet
  I do not condone that.

<h3>Batman: The Dark Knight</h3>

  One of the best movies Christian Bale has acted so far and Heath Ledger is
  truly a legendary Joker <br />
  in this movie. The quotes in this movie by the Joker is relatable and just
  love how the entire movie<br />
  was directed by Christopher Nolan.
</p>
<h3>Spiderman: No Way Home</h3>

  This may be a very brief reason as to why I love this movie and it's simply
  because I grew up watching <br />
  Toby McGuire as Spiderman and to see him make an appearance is very, very
  nostalgic. The movie <br />
  as a whole is well taken and has touched my heart.
