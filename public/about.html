<h1>About Me</h1>

  I have been a developer for at least 6 years now. I kickstarted my career in
  the software development field as a native Android application developer until
  present with about a year of experience as a fullstack developer using Java
  Spring framework.

  I have always been passionate about learning the different techstack available
  without narrowing down to only mobile application.
